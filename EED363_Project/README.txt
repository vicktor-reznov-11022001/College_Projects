The project intends to train machine learning models to predict whether
a customer will buy a certain type of product listed on an eCommerce
website or not. The models will help websites designer to create better
sales strategies i.e. offering discounts and offers to customers while they
are browsing for products in real-time. To do this, we will rely on
session and visitor information and use the various machine learning
techniques to reach the target audience, offering them the most relevant
products for purchase. In this project, we have used 6 different models:
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree,
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors. We have also
divided our data into various testing experiments to observe the changes
upon standardizing, undersampling for majority class oversampling for
minority class, and computed their results later in a confusion matrix to
obtain various quantities such as accuracy, success rate, sensitivity, and
other such parameters of the model finding out the best model for each
experiment. The techniques and coding part have been done in Python
and executed using a Jupyter notebook.
